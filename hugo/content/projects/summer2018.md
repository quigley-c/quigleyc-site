## A Brief Synopsis
During the Summer of 2018 I worked with [Dr. Aravind Mohan](https://cs.allegheny.edu/sites/amohan/) to deconstruct  
algorithms that attempted to solve the well known Scheduling Problem in the realm of cloud computing. This research led to my presentation of a poster detailing our work towards the end of the research period.

## Scheduling Problem
The scheduling problem in the field of computer science and cloud computing is a problem in which there are  
a number of commodity machines in a workflow that need to be partitioned in order to achieve the highest  
degree of efficiency. There are two possible ways of measuring efficiency, namely Cost and Time.  
We focused on analyzing the algorithms that attempted to solve the scheduling problem in terms of cost.
