## A Brief Synopsis
My work over the summer of 2017 with Professor [Xiaoling Shi](https://sites.google.com/a/allegheny.edu/xiaoling-shi/)
was about postmodernism and the influances it had on  
the particular work, A Death In Chicago by Xianyoung. I did much reasearch on postmodernist works during the 1920's era  
that may have influanced Xianyoung's work.
