### Carson Quigley  
Currently a student at Allegheny College, enjoys working in many programming languages  
such as C, Java, Python, Bash, Lua, and more!  
  
I'm a huge fan of the linux Operating System and do much of my work from my Google pixelbook running [Debian](https://debian.org) with [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton)!
I also run [ArchLinux](http://archlinux.org) on most of my computers including my home desktop.
